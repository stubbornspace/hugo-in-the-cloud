### INGREDIENTS

* 1 large onion, chopped
* 2 garlic cloves
* 1 lb Italian sausages meat
* 3 tbsp sweet paprika
* 2 large glasses of dry white wine
* 3 cups stock
* 1 lb bucatini, broken into 4inch strips
* 1/4 cup parmesan
* bunch of chives
* t tbs of tomato puree
* olive oil, salt & fresh black pepper


### DESTRUCTIONS

Heat 2tbs of olive oil over medium-high heat, add the onions and sauté until translucent, about 3-4 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a further 2-3 minutes.

**In a large, wide sauté pan with lid, heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the onions and sauté until translucent and starting to brown. Add the sausage and crumble as it browns. Once the sausage is cooked through, about 4 minutes, add the paprika and salt. Sauté for 30 seconds to a minute to release the oils and flavors of the paprika.**

Deglaze the pan with the white wine. Scrape the bottom of the pan as it bubbles to release the bits of flavor. Add 1 cup of the stock. Once it comes to a boil, add the bucatini and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cover the pan. Stir often making sure the bucatini doesn’t stick to the bottom. Once the sauce begins to reduce and thicken, add stock one cup at a time, stirring and covering in between stirs. Continue doing this with the remaining stock until the pasta is cooked through. It will take anywhere between 16-18 minutes. This is like cooking risotto; adding liquid as needed until cooked through.

**Once the bucatini is al-dente, toss in the parmesan and some black pepper. Check for seasoning and adjust with the salt. Plate and garnish with chives and parmesan. Enjoy!**
