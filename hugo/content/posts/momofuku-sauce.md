# MomoFuku's Awesome Scallion Sauce


### Ingredients
* 2 1⁄2 cups thinly sliced scallions (greens and whites; from 1 to 2 large bunches)
* 1⁄2 cup finely minced peeled fresh ginger
* 1⁄4 cup grapeseed or other neutral oil
* 1 1⁄2 tsp. usukuchi (light soy sauce)
* 3⁄4 tsp. sherry vinegar
* 3⁄4 tsp. kosher salt, or more to taste

### Instructions
Mix together the scallions, ginger, oil, soy, vinegar, and salt in a bowl. Taste and check for salt, adding more if needed. Though it's best after 15 or 20 minutes of sitting, ginger scallion sauce is good from the minute it's stirred together up to a day or two in the fridge. Use as directed, or apply as needed.
